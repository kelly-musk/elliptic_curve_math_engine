# Public Key Derivation

## Flow
- Using the point arithmetic on the secp256k1 curve, we can derive a private key 
- Using the private key gotten and the generator point with Discrete logarithm problem difficulty to prevent reverse engineering of the private key from the public key, we can derive the public key
